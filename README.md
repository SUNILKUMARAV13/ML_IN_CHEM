Understanding MSE: The MSE of 213.72 indicates a moderate level of prediction error. Lower MSE signifies better model accuracy, with predictions closer to actual values.

Model Tuning: Improve model performance by adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth) through grid search, randomized search, or automated tuning tools.

Feature Engineering: Enhance the model by adding interaction terms, creating new features, or reducing dimensionality to better capture underlying data relationships.

Alternative Models: Explore different models like Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks, and consider ensemble methods to potentially reduce error.

Cross-Validation and Error Analysis: Implement cross-validation for reliable performance measures and conduct residual analysis to identify patterns or outliers that affect model accuracy.
